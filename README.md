# Machine Learning Project 

The subject of this project is to apply a Machine Learning model onto different datasets. The idea is to implement a unique Machine Learning workflow and apply it to :

 - Kidney Disease 
 - BankNote

We choose to work on a typical supervised learning task : binary classification. 

Through this project we take a closer look to different functions used to implement the workflow and its results for the two databases mentioned above.
